        <p> Major League Baseball is a professional baseball organization that is the oldest of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. Total of 30 teams now play in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), with 15 teams in each league. Michael Nelson "Mike" Trout, nicknamed The Millville Meteor, is an American professional baseball center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball. Bryce Aron Max Harper is an American professional baseball right fielder for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball. Harper was chosen by the Nationals with the first overall pick in the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft</p>

        <p> Harper won the NL Rookie of the Year Award in 2012. He tied for the NL lead in home runs in the 2015 Major League Baseball season, and was named the National League Most Valuable Player for 2015 by unanimous decision of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.On April 14, 2016, Harper hit his first career grand slam for his 100th career home run in a game against the Atlanta Braves. On April 17, 2016, Harper hit a home run for a 4th straight game, setting a new career streak for most consecutive games with a home run.The grand slam was his only hit in four at-bats, which lowered his average to .333. More importantly, Harper's power continues to be absolutely ridiculous, as his slugging percentage is up to .867. With seven home runs in 13 games, Harper is on pace for 87 on the year. Take "on pace" numbers with a grain of salt as always, but Harper is as good a bet to challenge records as anybody in baseball these days.
